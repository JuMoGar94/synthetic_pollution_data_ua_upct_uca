## Abstract

Pollution in urban areas is turning into a primary focus for local governments in developed nations around the globe. Lots of data are currently collected for this from smart developments provided with atmospheric and climatic sensors. A hot research line is now exploiting such data to extract patterns and predict pollution levels in such a way that countermeasures can be taken beforehand and exposure to harmful concentrations is avoided. However, a key issue is the lack of significant data, due to incomplete smart infrastructures or calibration problems in sensors. Dealing with this, in this paper we propose the exploitation of synthetic data generation to enhance pollution prediction based on limited data sources, concretely extending real measurements of two weeks to up to ten extra years. Since the impact of data synthesis in pollution prediction has not been assessed in the literature thoroughly until now, we present a data generation approach through different strategies based on Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs). From the obtained results, an appropriate mixture of real and synthetic data, or models trained with artificial data and then re-trained with real data extracted afterwards using transfer learning techniques, can outperform clearly the results obtained solely with available real measurements.
